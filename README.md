## This repository is currently under development, and the final code updates are in progress. Please wait until the update is complete to ensure accurate usage and functionality. Thank you for your patience!

## Introduction
This repository implements a novel approach to Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for advanced feature interactions. By constructing inter- and intra-region graphs, our method combines global and local features to enhance visual pattern recognition. Using shared GNNs with an attention mechanism and the APPNP algorithm, our approach optimizes information flow, boosting model efficiency and stability with residual connections. Achieving state-of-the-art results on FGVC benchmarks, this work highlights GNNs' potential in capturing complex visual details.

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Virtual Environment Setup (Recommended)
For setting up a virtual environment, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) to manage dependencies efficiently. Anaconda simplifies the process of creating isolated environments through `conda` and ensures compatibility across packages. To get started, run the following commands in your console:

```bash
# Create a new Conda environment with other basic packages from anaconda channel
conda create -n myenv anaconda python=3.9

# Activate the Conda environment
conda activate myenv

# Install necessary packages
pip install tensorflow
pip install opencv-python
pip install spektral
pip install wandb
```
This will set up your environment with the required libraries for running the project. Additionally,
- Please ensure that TensorFlow with CUDA support is correctly installed by following the official [TensorFlow installation guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) if you're using a GPU. For optimal performance, a GPU with a minimum of 16GB of VRAM (dedicated memory) is recommended.

- It's also recommended to use Weights & Biases (WandB) for tracking metrics such as training and validation accuracy. Start by creating a WandB account and obtaining your API key from the [quickstart guide](https://docs.wandb.ai/quickstart). In the `train.py` file, locate the following line:

```python
wandb.login(key="########## PUT YOUR WandB API HASH KEY HERE #################")  # WandB API key
```

Replace `"########## PUT YOUR WandB API HASH KEY HERE #################"` with your actual API key to enable WandB integration.
